## 3.1 Explanation of variables:

1.  `gest` is gestational age in weeks. 40 weeks is considered normal.
2.  `birthweight` is birth weight in
3.  `preterm`

## 4.1 Log transformation

In the original post, modeling is done on the log scale. However, itâ€™s
not totally clear to me that the log transformation yields a better fit.

``` r
ds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gest, y = birthweight)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  labs(title = "birthweight vs gestational age")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

``` r
ds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(gest), y = log(birthweight))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  labs(title = "log(birthweight) vs log(gestational age)")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

## 4.2 Interaction between gestational age and preterm

``` r
ggpairs(ds[,c("birthweight", "gest", "preterm")])
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
